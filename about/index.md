### Hi. I am Manish Nikam

I am a full-stack application developer, an avid learner and a decent gamer. 

<hr />

### Technology

<br />
###### Past

I have worked on a lot of different technologies when I was in college. This includes **Android application development**, **web-apps** along with other things.

I have also developed games using **C++ Graphics Library**, **Blender Game Engine** and **Unity 3D**.

Here's a quick overview of all the tech I know!

###### Present

I work primarily on **Ruby on Rails** and **ReactJS** along with other front-end technologies like **Redux**, **jQuery** and **Bootstrap**.

I design UI/UX and develop graphics related to them. I majorly make use of the very underrated **PowerPoint** (ðŸ˜²), to develop the said designs & graphics.

Take a look!

<div style='display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;'>
    <img class='round-corners' style="border-radius: 15px" width='250px;' height='250px' src='/assets/images/face.jpg' />
    <img class='round-corners' style="border-radius: 15px"  height='250px' src='/assets/images/setup.jpg' />
</div>


###### Future

I have started working in the DevOps field, majorly Docker & Kubernetes.

Looking forward to contribute to the open-source community.

### Gaming

I majorly play **CS:GO** & **PokÃ©mon GO**.

###### CS:GO

My in-game alias is ***Cortana***. My rank is **Gold Nova Master** and I am an **AWPER**. I have good rifle skills, and know the spray control of major weapons like the **AK** and both the **M4s**.

###### PokÃ©mon GO

I am an **L33 Mystic** trainer. I am a returning player, stopped playing in March 2017, and joined back again in February 2019.
My trainer code is: **0610 3512 3930**, if you want to be friend in-game or otherwise.
